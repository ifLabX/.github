## 🌱 Organization & Activities

ifLabX is dedicated to building a technical community centered on “open collaboration, fast growth, and continuous innovation.” We advocate open source, love AI, and encourage learning and improvement through real-world projects and online sharing.

### 🧩 Organization

- **Self-governed Groups, Interest Driven**  
  The community is organized into various interest groups (e.g., 🤖 AI, 🌐 Frontend, 🛠️ Hardware). Each group is guided by a coordinator. Members can freely join or start new groups for self-driven growth and knowledge sharing.
  
- **Project-centric, Contribution First**  
  Practice is at the core. We encourage team product development, tool building, and all forms of contribution—code, docs, design, or ideas. All contributions are valued; real influence comes from actual output.

- **Documentation Driven, Knowledge Sharing**  
  Important discussions, progress, and decisions are documented and archived in the community knowledge base, allowing newcomers to quickly learn about the culture and project history.

- **Mentor & Shadowing**  
  Experienced members volunteer as mentors, guiding newcomers through a “shadow” model: observing, suggesting, fixing docs, and gradually contributing code—helping new members integrate smoothly.

### 🎯 Activities

- **🚀 Project Sprints**  
  Regular online sprints (e.g., quarterly Build Sprint): teams develop from idea to demo rapidly. Results are showcased online; outstanding projects earn community badges.

- **🎤 Topic Talks & Online Sharing**  
  Members regularly initiate online sharing sessions on open source practice, AI technology, tool skills, etc. Videos and docs are archived for all.

- **🤝 Product Co-creation & Open Collaboration**  
  Everyone is welcome to collaborate via issues, PRs, and discussions—from planning to development to release. “Learn by building, collaborate by learning.”

- **📌 Public Roadmap & Growth OKRs**  
  A quarterly public roadmap details project goals and community events. Members are encouraged to set personal growth OKRs for ongoing progress.

- **🏅 Recognition & Community Honors**  
  Active contributors, outstanding project leads, and top content creators earn badges and public recognition, fostering a positive and inclusive culture.
